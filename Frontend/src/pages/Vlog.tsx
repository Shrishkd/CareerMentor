              Why I Built Career Mentor — <br/>
              <span className="text-primary">And Why It Matters.</span>

                The journey from a struggling job seeker to building an AI platform that empowers thousands wasn't easy. It started with a simple realization: the interview process is broken, and talent often goes unnoticed due to a lack of preparation resources.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-6">The Struggle</h2>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                Years ago, I found myself in the same position as many of you. Resume in hand, skills sharpened, yet facing rejection after rejection. It wasn't a lack of technical ability, but a lack of understanding of what interviewers were truly looking for. The anxiety of the unknown, the pressure of the moment, and the silence after the interview were deafening.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-6">The Vision</h2>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                I realized that what was missing was a safe space to fail. A place to practice, receive instant feedback, and improve without the stakes being life-altering. That's when the idea for Career Mentor was born. I wanted to democratize access to high-quality interview coaching, making it accessible to everyone, everywhere.
